# How to install Python 3.7

At some point needed to test system using Python 3.7 I ran into problem of
installing it when pyenv failed to install with error message about OpenSSL.

The following worked in my case

```fish
$ set -x CONFIGURE_OPTS --with-openssl=(brew --prefix openssl)
$ pyenv install 3.7.1
```

It is always recommended to look on troubleshooting notes at https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Common-build-problems.
